Scrape CAA Info
===============

The [Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)] (http://www.caa.co.uk/) publish their 'G-INFO' [database of every registered aircraft] (http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype=65&appid=1). This scrapes those records into a CSV.

Requires a recent version of [Node JS] (http://nodejs.org/).

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, then run `node caa-info`.
