Scrape CAA Info
===============

The [Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)](https://www.caa.co.uk/) publish their 'G-Info' [database of every registered aircraft](http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/modalapplication.aspx?appid=1). This scrapes those records into a CSV.

Requires a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, then run `node caa-info`.
